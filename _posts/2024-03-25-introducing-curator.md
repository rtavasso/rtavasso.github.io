I'm excited to share more about curator, my current project focused on advancing AI tooling for music producers. The vision is clear: empower creativity, don't replace it.

## The Vision

Curator represents the next step in AI tooling for music production. Unlike existing AI tools that aim to generate or replace human creativity, curator is designed to enhance the producer's workflow and creative process.

## Why This Matters

The intersection of AI and music raises important questions about creativity, consciousness, and the role of technology in art. Through curator, I'm exploring how we can develop AI tools that respect and amplify human creativity rather than attempting to replicate or replace it.

More details about curator and its development will be shared in future posts. Stay tuned!
