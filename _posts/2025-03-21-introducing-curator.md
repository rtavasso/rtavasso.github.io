The vision is clear: empower creativity, don't replace it. curator represents the next step in AI tooling for music production. 

## Why This Matters

The intersection of AI and music raises important questions about creativity and the role of technology in art. I'm exploring how we can develop AI tools that respect and amplify human creativity rather than attempting to replace it.

More details about curator and its development will be shared in future posts. Stay tuned!
