Welcome to my blog exploring the fascinating intersections of artificial intelligence, consciousness, and music production. Here, I'll be sharing thoughts on AI development, philosophy of mind, and the future of creative technology.

## What to Expect

This blog will explore various topics including:
- AI development and its implications for consciousness
- Music production and AI tooling
- Philosophy of mind and artificial consciousness
- Ethical considerations in AI development
- Updates on curator and AI music production tools

Join me in exploring these topics as we work towards empowering, rather than replacing, human creativity.
